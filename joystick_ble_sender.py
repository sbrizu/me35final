# ME35 Final: Football — Multi-Robot Soccer System ⚽🤖

This repository contains the full software stack for our ME35 Final Project (“Football”): a cooperative multi-robot system designed to score as many goals as possible within a five-minute match.

The system integrates a ball dispenser, a remotely controlled defensive robot, and an autonomous robot using AprilTag localization and computer vision.

## 🎯 System Goal

The goal of this project is to design and implement a coordinated multi-robot system capable of repeatedly scoring goals under time constraints. A remotely controlled robot retrieves balls from a custom-built dispenser and delivers them to an autonomous robot. The autonomous robot then uses AprilTag-based localization and vision-based ball detection to navigate, align, and launch the ball into the goal.
